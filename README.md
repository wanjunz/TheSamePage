### Overview

Readers, rejoice! The Same Page is here for you to log all the books on your TBR list, as well as those you're currently reading and have already completed. Ever want to talk to someone about what's going on in your book but no one around you has seemed to have read it? Or do you Well, you're in luck! Just open up the corresponding forum we have on our site, release your thoughts, and continue reading! Curious about whether you should start a new book? Just pop open the forum! Want to warn others about what NOT to read? Just open up the forum! The Same Page is here for you and all your needs. 

### Creating Accounts

To begin, you should register for an account on the register page, which can be found in the menu. Afterwards, you will be brought to the login page where you should log into your newly created account! This will bring you to your personal home page! If you also wish to access the login page when you aren't already logged in, in addition to pressing the log in option in the menu, you may also press The Same Page in the top left corner of the page (if you're already logged in, this will bring you to your home page). 

### User Home Page

Here's your personal space for your future, current, and past reads! When you log in and open this page, you'll only see a greeting and a line expressing your lack of books in your TBR (to be read) list. To add books, head over to the search page, search for books you want to read, and press the plus icon! 

Once you have added books to your TBR list through the search page, you'll see these books appear on your home page. For each of them, you'll see three icons: a forum button (to open the forum for that book), a book button (to mark this book as now being one you're currently reading), and a remove button (to remove this book from your TBR list). 

Once you mark books as ones you're currently reading, you'll see them in the corresponding space below your TBR list with three icons as well: a forum button (opens the forum, as before), a check mark button (to signify you've finished the book), and a remove button (to signify you no longer want the book on your current reads list). 

As before, once you've marked a book as being completed, the list of books you've completed will be shown below your currently reading list! Here, each of these books will have two icons: a forum button and a remove button as before, in the case you want to visit the corresponding forum or remove the book from your home page. 

### Search Page

Once you open this page, you'll find yourself met with a search box telling you to search for a book title. Here is where you should input a book title (it doesn't have to be the complete title but you must input complete words if the word is in the title of the book you're looking for) to search for books. Once you've inputted words in our search box, books will start appearing below the search box! These books will have your words in their titles and each book will be listed with two icons: a plus (to add the book to your TBR list) and a forum one (to view the forum). Click these to proceed! If you click the plus, you'll be brought back to your home page to view your newly added book. Otherwise, if you click the forum icon, you'll be brought to the corresponding forum page. 

### Forum Page

Once you access a book's forum page, you'll be able to see all comments (with replies) that users have left on that forum about the book. You'll be able to see the user's username, comment, date added, and percentage through the book they were on (if applicable) when it was added. If you'd like to reply to an existing comment, simply click the reply button under their comment and a textbox will appear, allowing you to type your reply and submit it! Once submitted, you should see your reply on the forum page. 

If you would not like to reply to someone else's comment, but instead start your own thread for a comment, simply use the text box at the top of the page, directly under the book's cover photo! Type your comment in the box and if you'd like to add the page you're currently on when making the comment, feel free to do so! Afterwards, just press the upload comment button and you should see your comment on the thread. 

You can also filter through the comments so you don't see any spoilers or comments made from users who are further along in the book than you. Simply input the page number you want to see comments up to and then press 'enter'. 

### Contributions

Want to remove a comment you've previously posted? No worries, just visit the contributions page to view all of the comments you've posted on any one of our forums. Then, click the trash button at the top right corner of the corresponding button and your comment will be marked as '[deleted comment]'.

### Log Out

We'll be sad to see you go but if you want to log out of your account, simply press the log out button in the menu to be logged out. You'll be brought to the login page from there. Be sure to come back soon!
